# Tic Tac Toe
=======================

Link to the game - [Tic Tac Toe](https://danimart1357.github.io/project-0/?fbclid=IwAR0jdwZsyvF490zkbTWSxtqvXiy1GRWWRpz9fK3LGDUPV0hqy1R_yXGHNuw)
 
This is my first code project I have done for General Assembly.

This game was created using HTML, CSS and JQuery.

I used the New York Times "Wordle" game as an inspiration for the color scheme and desing of my Tic Tac Toe game.

In future I plan on coming back and cleaning up the code to make it look better and also find a solution that is a lot easier to understand. I am still attempting to include a scoreboard into the game
